## Workflow

We are using a standard github workflow in this project:

1. [Find an issue](https://github.com/crf-devs/resop/issues) you want to work on, and discuss about it on Github or on Discord
1. [Create a fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) of the repository
1. [Create your new branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)
1. Work on it :-)
1. Run `make fix-cs` in order to clean you code
1. Run `make test` and fix everything if any
1. [Push your branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push)
1. [Create your pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request),
    you can add `Closes #xxx` in its description in order to link it with an existing issue
1. While you are still working on you PR, you can add a `WIP: ` prefix to its name
